The virus outbreak has revealed the risks involved with that strategy, with analysts warning that if the epidemic gets worse and the economic pain is deeper than expected, Xi will bear the blame.“This would hurt his own credibility,” said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s Centre for China Studies. “The Chinese were not made aware of the true picture early enough,” he said, adding that internal communication within the Communist Party “wasn’t useful unless made public.”The speech also unveiled for the first time that Xi was behind the aggressive measure to quarantine millions in Hubei, the province at the epicenter of the outbreak.“I explicitly demanded Hubei province implement comprehensive and strict controls on the outflow of personnel on Jan. 22,” Xi said.(Updates with analyst comment in seventh paragraph.)To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Sharon Chen in Beijing at schen462@bloomberg.net;Peter Martin in Beijing at pmartin138@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Shamim Adam at sadam2@bloomberg.net, Sharon Chen, James MaygerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear="all">";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"https://news.yahoo.com/xi-details-hands-approach-virus-122002665.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 16 Feb 2020 07:50:04 -0500";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"source";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"Bloomberg";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:3:"url";s:26:"https://www.bloomberg.com/";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"xi-details-hands-approach-virus-122002665.html";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:3:{s:7:"content";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:6:"height";s:2:"86";s:3:"url";s:212:"http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zYpNwqdsAlDl2JLd8oqRaA--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/prod/2020-02/10/5e4176d1cbde7335f1cdf17c/5e4176d1cbde7335f1cdf17d_o_U_v2.jpg";s:5:"width";s:3:"130";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"text";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5009:"<p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/xi-details-hands-approach-virus-122002665.html"><img src="http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zYpNwqdsAlDl2JLd8oqRaA--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/prod/2020-02/10/5e4176d1cbde7335f1cdf17c/5e4176d1cbde7335f1cdf17d_o_U_v2.jpg" width="130" height="86" alt="Xi Details Early Hands-On Approach in Virus Fight, Risking Anger" align="left" title="Xi Details Early Hands-On Approach in Virus Fight, Risking Anger" border="0" ></a>(Bloomberg) -- China released a speech showing President Xi Jinping was leading the national effort to contain the coronavirus almost two weeks before he first issued public orders on the outbreak, potentially exposing him to more criticism as anger mounts over the government’s initial response.In the Feb. 3 speech, Xi told China’s most powerful leaders that he had “continuously given verbal and written instructions” since Jan. 7, and had personally ordered the quarantine of about 60 million people in Hubei province later that month.

The virus outbreak has revealed the risks involved with that strategy, with analysts warning that if the epidemic gets worse and the economic pain is deeper than expected, Xi will bear the blame.“This would hurt his own credibility,” said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s Centre for China Studies. “The Chinese were not made aware of the true picture early enough,” he said, adding that internal communication within the Communist Party “wasn’t useful unless made public.”The speech also unveiled for the first time that Xi was behind the aggressive measure to quarantine millions in Hubei, the province at the epicenter of the outbreak.“I explicitly demanded Hubei province implement comprehensive and strict controls on the outflow of personnel on Jan. 22,” Xi said.(Updates with analyst comment in seventh paragraph.)To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Sharon Chen in Beijing at schen462@bloomberg.net;Peter Martin in Beijing at pmartin138@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Shamim Adam at sadam2@bloomberg.net, Sharon Chen, James MaygerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear="all">";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"credit";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"role";s:18:"publishing company";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"Iran&amp;#39;s Rouhani says Tehran will never talk to U.S. under pressure";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/irans-rouhani-says-tehran-never-124958001.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 16 Feb 2020 07:49:58 -0500";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"source";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"Reuters";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:3:"url";s:23:"http://www.reuters.com/";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"irans-rouhani-says-tehran-never-124958001.html";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:6:"credit";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"role";s:18:"publishing company";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"Why Xi&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;defensive&amp;#39;

Does he still have a chance of taking power? Here&#39;s everything you need to know:Why was Guaidó in Washington?  A year after he swept onto the international stage as the leader of an uprising that could bring democracy to Venezuela, Juan Guaidó&#39;s star has dimmed. In January 2019, Guaidó was the head of the National Assembly, the only democratically elected body remaining in the country after President Nicolás Maduro won a rigged election for a second term. The assembly declared Maduro illegitimate and Guaidó, then 35, acting president. He quickly tried to foment a general uprising against the corrupt, authoritarian Maduro regime, hoping that the army would come to his side. The U.S. and most Western governments recognized him as Venezuela&#39;s rightful leader, but Russia rushed to shore up Maduro&#39;s control, and the attempt to overthrow Maduro soon fizzled. Since then, Venezuelan politics have been in a stalemate, with Maduro still fully in charge. Last month, Maduro supporters locked Guaidó and his followers out of the parliament, and Guaidó launched a two-week world tour in hopes of regaining momentum for his opposition movement, ending his trip in Washington.What did Trump promise?  President Trump singled out Guaidó as a guest of honor at the State of the Union address, calling him &quot;the true and legitimate president of Venezuela&quot; leading a &quot;righteous struggle for freedom.&quot; Trump held up Venezuela&#39;s economic collapse as an example of the evils of socialism, a sign that he intends to use the country as a cautionary tale throughout his re-election campaign. Trump administration officials said the U.S. was preparing &quot;crippling&quot; new sanctions against Maduro&#39;s government, but offered no details. The Trump administration had already frozen all Venezuelan government assets, barred transactions with U.S. companies, and enacted an oil embargo. Though aimed at Maduro, those actions furthered the collapse of the Venezuelan economy. The GDP has shrunk a staggering 73 percent since Maduro took office, and hyperinflation has rendered the bolivar worthless. But Maduro still has powerful friends, notably Russia.How is Russia helping Maduro?  Russia has supported Venezuela ever since Maduro&#39;s predecessor, the late Hugo Chávez, was elected in 1998 to bring old-style socialism to the country. Eager to project power in the United States&#39; own hemisphere, Russia sold some $4 billion worth of weaponry to Venezuela from 2005 to 2008 and began making deep investments in its energy sector. Since Maduro took office in 2013, the Kremlin has propped him up financially and militarily, sending him 36 Russian Su-30MK2 fighter jets worth $10 billion. When Maduro seemed at his weakest last spring, Russia sent military advisers and the S-300 surface-to-air missile system — to demonstrate that the risks of U.S. military intervention would be high. And when Trump hit Venezuela with sanctions last summer, Russian state oil company Rosneft rescued Maduro by flouting the sanctions and became the main trader of Venezuelan oil, shipping it to buyers in China and India. Russia also made available billions of dollars in loans, and a Russian bank began offering Venezuela&#39;s new cryptocurrency, the Petro.How is Venezuela&#39;s economy?  The Russian infusion of cash, coupled with Maduro&#39;s recent abandonment of socialist price controls, has greatly benefited Venezuela&#39;s wealthy elite. Caracas, once a scene of empty shelves, gas lines, and mass protests, now bustles with new restaurants and bars and other signs of private enterprise. With Maduro&#39;s encouragement, Venezuelans who hoarded U.S. dollars early on are now spending them on imported food, cars, and entertainment. For those who were true believers in Chávez&#39;s socialism — which did lift many out of poverty initially — the garish spectacle of extreme inequality is appalling. &quot;This is savage capitalism that erases years of struggle,&quot; Elías Jaua, Chávez&#39;s former vice president, told The New York Times.What about outside the capital?  Conditions are grim. In smaller towns and cities, government workers, including police, have quit after months without pay, and basic services like water and electricity are spotty or absent. Schools are run by unpaid volunteer teachers. In Parmana, for example, once a prosperous fishing and farming village, nearly all authority figures left, including the priest and the doctor, and the villagers, facing anarchy, were forced to invite Colombian guerrillas in to restore order. Most people who can afford to leave the country have already done so, an exodus of some 4 million, but the U.N. fears that another 4 million of the desperately poor could join them this year.What next?  Guaidó doesn&#39;t have much time left to exert a claim on power. The U.S., EU, and Latin American countries recognize him as interim president because he has a constitutional role as head of the National Assembly. But parliamentary elections are due this year, and since Maduro controls the electoral apparatus and process, his party is sure to win. Latin American leaders are pushing for negotiations that would bring together Maduro and Guaidó along with their respective backers, including Russia and Cuba on one side and the U.S. and EU on the other. The goal is to allow Maduro a peaceful exit. &quot;It&#39;s about building a golden bridge,&quot; said former Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, a Nobel Peace Prize winner. &quot;For Venezuela, we need a peaceful negotiated solution — with all the ­stakeholders.&quot;The Venezuelan diaspora   By the end of 2019, more than 4.7 ­million ­Venezuelans — some 15 percent of the ­population — ​had left the country, fleeing hunger, poverty, and rampant crime in the largest displacement in Lat­in Amer­i­can history. Most got only as far as Co­lom­bia, Peru, or Ecua­dor, where they are struggling to survive. To help relieve the world&#39;s other major refugee crisis, from Syria, international donors have given some $5,000 per migrant; for Vene­zue­la, the figure is just $100. Neigh­bor­ing Co­lom­bia, where 1.6 million migrants have landed, is trying to integrate them rather than house them in camps, with some success: Venezuelan doctors have been recertified, and unskilled laborers have found work on coffee and flower ranches. But homelessness and crime have skyrocketed. &quot;We can&#39;t control 2,200 kilometers of border,&quot; said border official Felipe Muñoz.This article was first published in the latest issue of The Week magazine.

The U.S., EU, and Latin American countries recognize him as interim president because he has a constitutional role as head of the National Assembly. But parliamentary elections are due this year, and since Maduro controls the electoral apparatus and process, his party is sure to win. Latin American leaders are pushing for negotiations that would bring together Maduro and Guaidó along with their respective backers, including Russia and Cuba on one side and the U.S. and EU on the other. The goal is to allow Maduro a peaceful exit. &quot;It&#39;s about building a golden bridge,&quot; said former Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, a Nobel Peace Prize winner. &quot;For Venezuela, we need a peaceful negotiated solution — with all the ­stakeholders.&quot;The Venezuelan diaspora   By the end of 2019, more than 4.7 ­million ­Venezuelans — some 15 percent of the ­population — ​had left the country, fleeing hunger, poverty, and rampant crime in the largest displacement in Lat­in Amer­i­can history. Most got only as far as Co­lom­bia, Peru, or Ecua­dor, where they are struggling to survive. To help relieve the world&#39;s other major refugee crisis, from Syria, international donors have given some $5,000 per migrant; for Vene­zue­la, the figure is just $100. Neigh­bor­ing Co­lom­bia, where 1.6 million migrants have landed, is trying to integrate them rather than house them in camps, with some success: Venezuelan doctors have been recertified, and unskilled laborers have found work on coffee and flower ranches. But homelessness and crime have skyrocketed. &quot;We can&#39;t control 2,200 kilometers of border,&quot; said border official Felipe Muñoz.This article was first published in the latest issue of The Week magazine.

On 31 January, the 32-year-old Nigerian American learned in an email that the US was finally processing the visa applications of his wife and daughter in Nigeria.Hours later, Donald Trump shattered their celebration, announcing that he was adding six countries to the travel ban, including Nigeria. The decision cuts off pathways to permanent US residency for Nigerians, throwing Olumide’s case into limbo at the final stage of the process. It leaves his wife and and 11-year-old girl stuck across an ocean with little hope of making it to the US.“This is inhuman,” said Olumide, a systems analyst and US military veteran who served in Afghanistan and lives in Washington DC. He asked to use his middle name out of fear he might jeopardize his case. “As a soldier, I understand the need to protect the country. But to completely shut the doors … it’s just plain wrong.” Millions of Africans now banned: ‘We are not criminals’Trump’s January order builds on the 2017 travel ban that has continued to target five Muslim-majority countries, and significantly restricts permanent residency for nationals from Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria and Myanmar. It also blocks people from Tanzania and Sudan from obtaining green cards through the “diversity visa” lottery.Just like the 2017 restrictions, it blocks permanent immigration from the targeted countries, making limited exceptions if applicants prove that denials would cause “undue hardship” and that granting them visas would support “national interest”.number listThe original ban already resulted in denied visas for more than 42,000 people, the majority from Iran. The addition of the new countries has doubled the number of Muslims targeted across the globe to roughly 320 million, advocates estimate. Roughly one-quarter of all Africans are now affected.The restrictions now apply to 13 countries, including Nigeria, home to Africa’s largest population and economy. It cuts off countries where some are fleeing violence. Some estimate the new ban, which goes into effect on 21 February, could hinder more than 12,000 immigrants seeking to resettle in the US and reunite with family in the next year.The restrictions are a signature component of Trump’s aggressive anti-immigrant agenda, which has included curbs on legal migration, a destruction of the American asylum system, an all-time low cap on refugees, expanded detention and mass deportations.“Trump started out by scapegoating Muslims in 2017,” said Javeria Jamil, attorney with Asian Americans Advancing Justice’s Asian Law Caucus, who has been fielding calls from families affected by the new ban. “Now, it’s not just the Muslim ban. It has turned into an African ban.”The Trump administration has claimed that the ban, which blindsided some diplomats, is a national security measure, and that the added countries failed to meet US security and information-sharing standards.But immigrant rights groups said the policy is a political maneuver amid Trump’s re-election campaign – and one that will have profound consequences. “People are in turmoil,” said Audu Kadiri, a 43-year-old community organizer who left Nigeria in 2014. He had planned to bring his mother to the US, but the ban may make that impossible. The activist, who now lives in the Bronx, hasn’t yet told his mother about Trump’s order, because he doesn’t know how to break the news. “There is so much collateral damage, it’s hard to quantify.”In Nigeria, Kadiri was an LGBTQ+ rights advocate who worked on HIV prevention and other human rights issues. He was forced to flee due to his activism and sought asylum in the US. It’s now unsafe for him to return to Nigeria, which is why he wants his 68-year-old mother to come to the US.He hasn’t seen her since 2014 and, if Trump is re-elected, he fears it will be at least another five years before they reunite. She’ll probably miss the birth of his third child.“Nigerians have contributed to the development of this country, like every immigrant community,” he said. “We are not criminals.” Torn apart, with dwindling optionsBefore the January announcement, the Trump administration had already clamped down on travel from Africa, including hikes in visa fees, and new obstacles and increased denials for Nigerians seeking approval for short-term visits. The US further suspended visitor visas from Eritrea in 2017.That means families have been fighting for years to use the dwindling avenues available to them to reunite, and for those who have invested significant time and money into the process, the sudden news of an outright ban was particularly brutal.“There’s nothing you can do, and it makes you feel so helpless,” said Olumide, the veteran. Olumide arrived in the US from Nigeria when he was 10 years old. He met his wife in Nigeria in 2012 after he left the military, and the two got married last year.US Citizenship and Immigration Services approved the petition for his wife and daughter in January, just before the announcement of the ban. But they don’t yet have their visas – and the ban may make it impossible to get them.Olumide had hoped they would be starting their lives together in the US by now, and said he was pained by feelings of guilt: “I made promises to her.” The couple hasn’t fully processed the news, he added: “We don’t want to think about not being together.”He noted that his daughter has typhoid and his wife has malaria, and he constantly fears for their health and safety.Hana Mohamed, a 20-year-old student in San Diego, who grew up in Sudan, said she was eager for her grandparents to come to the US, especially so her grandmother could get medical care in California: “It’s just so sad and frustrating. They are getting older, and I want to see them before anything happens.”Mohamed said it was difficult to accept that the US was banning large groups of Muslims in the name of safety while seeming to do little about the ongoing terror threat of American mass shootings: “It’s just so shocking that we have come to this day where a whole nation of people are getting discriminated against. Isn’t the purpose of the United States to stand up for everyone who is getting hurt and treat them right?”&gt; Isn’t the purpose of the United States to stand up for everyone who is getting hurt and treat them right?&gt; &gt; Hana MohamedOne Eritrean American who works as an engineer in Silicon Valley, and requested anonymity for fear of hurting his family’s case, has petitioned for his mother to come live with him in the US and was hoping she would soon get an interview date at the embassy. Then the new ban was unveiled.“We’ve waited our turn. We’ve followed the law. I’m a tax-paying citizen contributing to the economy,” he said, noting that his mother is 69 years old and lives alone in Eritrea. “This is just pure evil.”He said he felt Trump was implementing the ban as a “soundbite for the campaign” while disregarding that it would leave Eritreans like his mother with no options: “This was our only hope to get her here.”For Eritreans, the ban comes as as the Trump administration has ramped up deportations of  Eritrean asylum seekers, despite the US government’s own acknowledgment of the torture and arbitrary detention Eritreans are currently facing.Abraham Zere, an Eritrean journalist who was granted asylum in the US and now lives in Ohio, said it seemed some Eritreans were reluctant to speak out about the ban and live in fear of potential repercussions from both governments: “People are scared to even discuss it.”Zere’s own family is affected: his mother is still in Eritrea, separated from her children. She can’t even video chat with her family because of the poor internet in Eritrea, which means she never gets to see her granddaughter, an eight-year-old she hasn’t yet met, he said.Some warn the ban may have life-or-death consequences. For queer and transgender migrants in the targeted countries, it could lead them to embark on perilous journeys to escape to the US as they run out of options, said Zack Mohamed, who is Somali American and a member of the Black LGBTQIA+ Migrant Project: “This is a big ‘not welcome’ sign in front of our faces.”In response to questions about the impact on migrants fleeing violence, a US state department spokesperson said the ban was not meant to “limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum”, adding: “Our first priority remains national security. We continue to work with our dedicated consular officers in the field to identify and expedite those individuals with urgent travel needs.”Asked about charges that the ban is discriminatory, the spokesperson said the restrictions are based on “nationality” and “visa category” and that “consular officers do not adjudicate based on religion”. The spokesperson said there were specific criteria to determine which countries are restricted and noted that Chad was on the original list but removed in 2018. Fighting to end the banWith the first travel ban upheld by the US supreme court, there are few recourses left to challenge the policy. Advocates are hoping a Democratic president will immediately repeal the ban and have also recently renewed the push for Congress to pass the No Ban Act, which would end the ban and prevent discriminatory immigration policies.Until then, Trump will continue to use his executive power to try to redefine what it means to be a citizen, advocates warned.“The president of the United States, the US government is explicitly trying to decide who gets to be an American,” said Eric Naing, who is Burmese American and works with Muslim Advocates, a group that has challenged the ban. His family would not have been able to come to the US if the ban on Myanmar had been in place. “He’s saying I shouldn’t be American. My parents shouldn’t be American. It’s deeply upsetting.”Olumide noted that the ban was punishing countless American citizens like him: “It’s hurting the exact people you’re trying to protect.”<p><br clear="all">";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"https://news.yahoo.com/trump-deciding-american-travel-ban-110027484.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 16 Feb 2020 06:00:27 -0500";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"source";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"The Guardian";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:3:"url";s:41:"https://www.theguardian.com/international";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:49:"trump-deciding-american-travel-ban-110027484.html";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:3:{s:7:"content";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:6:"height";s:2:"86";s:3:"url";s:174:"http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Xzf6AjWzLJSvOAsR6AuJVA--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/de159ead4a40459dd9b8e5c285689a88";s:5:"width";s:3:"130";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"text";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10853:"<p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/trump-deciding-american-travel-ban-110027484.html"><img src="http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Xzf6AjWzLJSvOAsR6AuJVA--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/de159ead4a40459dd9b8e5c285689a88" width="130" height="86" alt="&#39;Trump is deciding who is American&#39;: how the new travel ban is tearing families apart" align="left" title="&#39;Trump is deciding who is American&#39;: how the new travel ban is tearing families apart" border="0" ></a>As six countries are added to the list of restrictions, Nigerian and Eritreans in the US say the ban is devastating their livesIt started out as a joyous day for Olumide. On 31 January, the 32-year-old Nigerian American learned in an email that the US was finally processing the visa applications of his wife and daughter in Nigeria.Hours later, Donald Trump shattered their celebration, announcing that he was adding six countries to the travel ban, including Nigeria. The decision cuts off pathways to permanent US residency for Nigerians, throwing Olumide’s case into limbo at the final stage of the process. It leaves his wife and and 11-year-old girl stuck across an ocean with little hope of making it to the US.“This is inhuman,” said Olumide, a systems analyst and US military veteran who served in Afghanistan and lives in Washington DC. He asked to use his middle name out of fear he might jeopardize his case. “As a soldier, I understand the need to protect the country. But to completely shut the doors … it’s just plain wrong.” Millions of Africans now banned: ‘We are not criminals’Trump’s January order builds on the 2017 travel ban that has continued to target five Muslim-majority countries, and significantly restricts permanent residency for nationals from Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria and Myanmar. It also blocks people from Tanzania and Sudan from obtaining green cards through the “diversity visa” lottery.Just like the 2017 restrictions, it blocks permanent immigration from the targeted countries, making limited exceptions if applicants prove that denials would cause “undue hardship” and that granting them visas would support “national interest”.number listThe original ban already resulted in denied visas for more than 42,000 people, the majority from Iran. The addition of the new countries has doubled the number of Muslims targeted across the globe to roughly 320 million, advocates estimate. Roughly one-quarter of all Africans are now affected.The restrictions now apply to 13 countries, including Nigeria, home to Africa’s largest population and economy. It cuts off countries where some are fleeing violence. Some estimate the new ban, which goes into effect on 21 February, could hinder more than 12,000 immigrants seeking to resettle in the US and reunite with family in the next year.The restrictions are a signature component of Trump’s aggressive anti-immigrant agenda, which has included curbs on legal migration, a destruction of the American asylum system, an all-time low cap on refugees, expanded detention and mass deportations.“Trump started out by scapegoating Muslims in 2017,” said Javeria Jamil, attorney with Asian Americans Advancing Justice’s Asian Law Caucus, who has been fielding calls from families affected by the new ban. “Now, it’s not just the Muslim ban. It has turned into an African ban.”The Trump administration has claimed that the ban, which blindsided some diplomats, is a national security measure, and that the added countries failed to meet US security and information-sharing standards.But immigrant rights groups said the policy is a political maneuver amid Trump’s re-election campaign – and one that will have profound consequences. “People are in turmoil,” said Audu Kadiri, a 43-year-old community organizer who left Nigeria in 2014. He had planned to bring his mother to the US, but the ban may make that impossible. The activist, who now lives in the Bronx, hasn’t yet told his mother about Trump’s order, because he doesn’t know how to break the news. “There is so much collateral damage, it’s hard to quantify.”In Nigeria, Kadiri was an LGBTQ+ rights advocate who worked on HIV prevention and other human rights issues. He was forced to flee due to his activism and sought asylum in the US. It’s now unsafe for him to return to Nigeria, which is why he wants his 68-year-old mother to come to the US.He hasn’t seen her since 2014 and, if Trump is re-elected, he fears it will be at least another five years before they reunite. She’ll probably miss the birth of his third child.“Nigerians have contributed to the development of this country, like every immigrant community,” he said. “We are not criminals.” Torn apart, with dwindling optionsBefore the January announcement, the Trump administration had already clamped down on travel from Africa, including hikes in visa fees, and new obstacles and increased denials for Nigerians seeking approval for short-term visits. The US further suspended visitor visas from Eritrea in 2017.That means families have been fighting for years to use the dwindling avenues available to them to reunite, and for those who have invested significant time and money into the process, the sudden news of an outright ban was particularly brutal.“There’s nothing you can do, and it makes you feel so helpless,” said Olumide, the veteran. Olumide arrived in the US from Nigeria when he was 10 years old. He met his wife in Nigeria in 2012 after he left the military, and the two got married last year.US Citizenship and Immigration Services approved the petition for his wife and daughter in January, just before the announcement of the ban.

It&#39;s filmed vertically, obviously with a cell phone, and a corner of paper sometimes appears in the frame for a few seconds, as if the filmmaker — an administration intern? an aide? the anonymous author of that New York Times piece? — is trying to hide his camera work. Trump is standing in a hallway, maybe at the White House or Mar-a-Lago, and you can&#39;t see his conversation partner, whose voice from around the corner is a little muffled. But you can clearly see and hear Trump, and he says the n-word. Or he admits to committing election fraud in Michigan in 2016. Or he describes raping a woman on the set of The Apprentice. Or he reveals he already has bombers in the air, heading for Tehran. Or he says anything which fits with some established attribute or habit — his racism, his campaign&#39;s willingness (if not competence) to play dirty, his long history of sexual misconduct and assault, his militarism and snap judgments — but takes it to a newly horrifying level.You&#39;d believe it, right?And when Trump started issuing denials on Twitter, railing about the &quot;fake news&quot; and the &quot;witch hunt&quot; against him and the &quot;lying do-nothing Democrats&quot; who somehow made this compromising video, you&#39;d smirk. C&#39;mon. He obviously said it. We have video, and even if we didn&#39;t, it&#39;s entirely in step with his decades of public life. Plus, Trump lies constantly! He lies about stuff that doesn&#39;t matter at all. He has a record of denying saying things he said on tape. Remember &quot;Tim Apple&quot;? That&#39;s on video, but Trump still denied saying it. Or there&#39;s the time he called Meghan Markle &quot;nasty&quot; in a recorded interview, then pretended he didn&#39;t. So yeah, obviously the video is real. Obviously Trump is lying.But what if it wasn&#39;t real? What if Trump were telling the truth? What if the election outcome changed or we got into war with Iran over a deepfake? Tech experts have warned that a well-timed deepfake video could be used to sink the eventual Democratic nominee&#39;s campaign against Trump — but I suspect the president&#39;s unique history of immorality and dishonesty makes a convincing Trump deepfake the far greater risk.Truly convincing deepfakes have two elements. The first is technological proficiency, which, so far, most deepfakes lack. For example, a French charity released a Trump deepfake last year as a stunt to raise awareness about AIDs. The voice isn&#39;t great, and the face is visibly wonky:No one would be fooled by this for more than half a second — nor were they supposed to be.Likewise, a parody clip which inserted Trump&#39;s face into a scene from Better Call Saul is easily identified for the deepfake it is (the use of &quot;[Deepfake]&quot; in the title of the YouTube upload is also a giveaway):But deepfake tech is improving rapidly, and with a skilled voice actor, a Trump deepfake could be perfectly convincing. An organization with the resources of a movie studio could do it right now, and it won&#39;t be long before this type of lie is far more accessible than that. Look at this TikTok I ran across recently, in which footage from The Office combined with the right head shape and skin tone makes for a pretty solid deepfake of Steve Carrell:&gt; @iamjesserichards&gt; &gt; Like Mike michaelscott theoffice getthelook deepfake&gt; &gt; ♬ Sunday Best by Surfaces - rapidsongsTrump may be the most filmed man in the world. Any word you want him to say, you can find footage of him saying it and get the facial movements exactly right.The second part of a convincing deepfake is content plausibility. A few years ago, actor Jordan Peele made a PSA about deepfakes in which he voiced a video of former President Barack Obama. Peele&#39;s voice acting and the video quality are quite good — but, as &quot;Obama&quot; notes, he&#39;s saying things the real Obama would never say, signing off with, &quot;Stay woke, bitches.&quot;All of the leading Democratic candidates are conventional enough that it would be fairly difficult to hit on something their deepfake could say which would be both plausible and irreparably damning. For all but the reflexively partisan Republicans who never would have voted for a Democrat regardless, these candidates&#39; vehement denial of a deepfake video would hold some weight. It would at least buy them time for an investigation. The content plausibility would be hard to get so precisely right that no one would be skeptical.Not so with Trump. After &quot;both sides&quot; and &quot;shithole countries,&quot; would Trump saying the n-word when he believed himself to be speaking in private surprise you? After &quot;fire and fury&quot; and the Soleimani assassination, would a sudden attack on Iran be inconceivable?This is why Trump strikes me as the more likely candidate for an election-swinging deepfake attempt than any of his Democratic challengers. He has lied so much and so pointlessly, and he has said and done so many reprehensible things, that even his defenders probably would not question a well-designed deepfake.Done right, I might well fall for it. You — and Iran — might too.More stories from theweek.com  The sidelining of Elizabeth Warren  6 books Erik Larson keeps returning to  The NBA dunk contest was highly controversial<p><br clear="all">";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"https://news.yahoo.com/everyone-fall-trump-deepfake-120001184.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 15 Feb 2020 07:00:01 -0500";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"source";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"The Week";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:3:"url";s:20:"https://theweek.com/";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"everyone-fall-trump-deepfake-120001184.html";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:3:{s:7:"content";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:6:"height";s:2:"86";s:3:"url";s:168:"http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4ATtx.Ofhw5VWz41qUA.ug--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_week_574/beb20812faa33c622020647fd35710fd";s:5:"width";s:3:"130";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"text";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5907:"<p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/everyone-fall-trump-deepfake-120001184.html"><img src="http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4ATtx.Ofhw5VWz41qUA.ug--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_week_574/beb20812faa33c622020647fd35710fd" width="130" height="86" alt="Everyone would fall for a Trump deepfake" align="left" title="Everyone would fall for a Trump deepfake" border="0" ></a>Suppose tomorrow, or during the Republican National Convention, or maybe two days before the election, a video of President Trump appears.

Peele&#39;s voice acting and the video quality are quite good — but, as &quot;Obama&quot; notes, he&#39;s saying things the real Obama would never say, signing off with, &quot;Stay woke, bitches.&quot;All of the leading Democratic candidates are conventional enough that it would be fairly difficult to hit on something their deepfake could say which would be both plausible and irreparably damning. For all but the reflexively partisan Republicans who never would have voted for a Democrat regardless, these candidates&#39; vehement denial of a deepfake video would hold some weight. It would at least buy them time for an investigation. The content plausibility would be hard to get so precisely right that no one would be skeptical.Not so with Trump. After &quot;both sides&quot; and &quot;shithole countries,&quot; would Trump saying the n-word when he believed himself to be speaking in private surprise you? After &quot;fire and fury&quot; and the Soleimani assassination, would a sudden attack on Iran be inconceivable?This is why Trump strikes me as the more likely candidate for an election-swinging deepfake attempt than any of his Democratic challengers. He has lied so much and so pointlessly, and he has said and done so many reprehensible things, that even his defenders probably would not question a well-designed deepfake.Done right, I might well fall for it. You — and Iran — might too.More stories from theweek.com  The sidelining of Elizabeth Warren  6 books Erik Larson keeps returning to  The NBA dunk contest was highly controversial<p><br clear="all">";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"credit";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"role";s:18:"publishing company";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:19:{s:10:"x-amz-id-2";s:76:"sDUUrpTiEcoZylwOlUbol+bxX9dgy8fo2qcjm6F5c8i0bwFihesbzo6VgL97nQv4V6thG5zvHPk=";s:16:"x-amz-request-id";s:16:"B60B72F3C98CA21F";s:4:"date";s:29:"Sun, 16 Feb 2020 15:29:53 GMT";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Sun, 16 Feb 2020 15:29:15 GMT";s:4:"etag";s:34:""88c2c6d0df15d96808b89a8d38dc7b99"";s:28:"x-amz-server-side-encryption";s:6:"AES256";s:13:"cache-control";s:19:"public, max-age=600";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";s:12:"content-type";s:15:"application/xml";s:14:"content-length";s:6:"164243";s:6:"server";s:3:"ATS";s:15:"referrer-policy";s:26:"no-referrer-when-downgrade";s:4:"vary";s:6:"Origin";s:3:"age";s:3:"480";s:25:"strict-transport-security";s:16:"max-age=31536000";s:9:"expect-ct";s:95:"max-age=31536000, report-uri=http://csp.yahoo.com/beacon/csp?src=yahoocom-expect-ct-report-only";s:16:"x-xss-protection";s:13:"1; mode=block";s:22:"x-content-type-options";s:7:"nosniff";s:23:"content-security-policy";s:229:"sandbox allow-forms allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-presentation; report-uri https://csp.yahoo.com/beacon/csp?src=ats&site=news&region=US&lang=en-US&device=desktop&yrid=&partner=;";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20200216150435";}
